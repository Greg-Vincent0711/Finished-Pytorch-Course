Finished learning introductory Pytorch through [this](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA) course. 
I'd absolutely recommend this course for anyone with an interest in Machine Learning.
Through the course I recieved a strong basis in
- General Machine and Deep Learning concepts:
    - The difference between Deep and Machine Learning
    - The difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
    - Why ML/DL is needed, and when not to use it
- The fundamental data structure of DL - Tensors, and all of their methods
- Concepts local to using Pytorch in conjunction with other libraries like Numpy (parameter permutation, CPU vs GPU, etc)
- The general workflow for creating, training, and testing a model and Pytorch syntax
- CNNs on a fundamental and programmatic level
- Data visualization, loading, and augmentation for a more accurate model
